# Code, data, and idea sharing 

Some resources to get you started.

- Install R: https://muug.ca/mirror/cran/


- Install RStudio Desktop: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-desktop

- You've already found https://github.com but you'll need an account.

- Install git on your machine
  - Windows & OS X: http://git-scm.com/downloads
  - Debian/Ubuntu: __sudo apt-get install git-core__
  
  
- Re-start RStudio and then check if RStudio can find git  by running this in the terminal tab:
    - Mac, Linux: __which git__ 
    - most versions of Windows: __where git__ 
You should get back a result like: _usr/bin/git_ or _C:\Program Files (x86)\Git_
    
Hopefully RStudio can find git.  If not, quit and re-launch RStudio
